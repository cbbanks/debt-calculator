#Debt Calculator

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/seanjohnson08/debt-calculator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/seanjohnson08/debt-calculator)

A simple client-side calculator with graphing functionality to assist in financial planning. Users will be able to add their current debts, the amount of money they are willing to contribute to their debts each month, and will be able to chart out how long they will be paying down those debts, and how much money will be spent after all is said and done.

The tool will also assist the user in choosing the best "plan of attack" for their debts, so as to minimize longevity and cost.
